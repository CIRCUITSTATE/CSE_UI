  - Added text datum parameter to `lcdString` class.
    - This will help align the string in different ways.
    - Added `datum` which will hold the same type of text datum used by the `TFT_eSPI` library.
    - Added `setTextDatum()` method to set the text datum.
    - The text datum is loaded before drawing the string and the previous datum will be restored upon exiting.

  - `lcdString:: initialize()` now accepts a `font` parameter of type `uint8_t`.
    - `font` is initialized with `NULL` for backward compatibility.
  - `lcdString:: draw()` loads the font if it not `NULL`.
  - This allows the user to set a font for the string and not worry about loading it every time when drawing the string.
  - Added `API.md` and `Manual.md` files.
  - Added `Page.ino` example.
  - Updated `Readme.md` file.

  - Added Arduino library specification files.
  - Added Arduino vector library.
  - üêû The `buttonClass:: isTouched()` is producing an error.
    - The button coordinates are randomly overwritten when the touch panel is touched.
    - Added debug lines to print the touch coordinates and the button coordinates.
    - Removed the rotation since this is now handled in the CSE_Touch library.
  - üÜï Bumped up the version to `v0.0.8`
