  - `lcdString:: initialize()` now accepts a `font` parameter of type `uint8_t`.
    - `font` is initialized with `NULL` for backward compatibility.
  - `lcdString:: draw()` loads the font if it not `NULL`.
  - This allows the user to set a font for the string and not worry about loading it every time when drawing the string.
  - Added `API.md` and `Manual.md` files.
  - Added `Page.ino` example.
  - Updated `Readme.md` file.
